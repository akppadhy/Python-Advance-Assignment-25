    "\n",
    "*Network Connectivity Issues: There might be temporary network issues or connectivity problems when fetching stock data from an external source or API.\n",

    "\n",
    "By addressing these potential issues through proper validation, error handling, and providing informative messages to the user, you can enhance\n",
    "the user experience and ensure more robust handling of stock ticker symbols.\n"
